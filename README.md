### About

So what is Hydrogen? What can you do with it? 

Let me explain,  I create Hydrogen for my personal projects and todos, tasks, notes for everyday.  There are so many options for todo and note apps,  But I just got tired and frustrated, I cant find exactly what I want to work wit. My needs are:

* A tree structure list to contain my tasks or todos. 
* Tasks should have child tasks, child tasks can also have child tasks. 
* Task shold be as easy as possible, I dont need so many options, because everything is personal
* An easy but powerful editor for task details (markdown, wysiwyg)
* Some strategy to work with my tasks , eg scrum model
* And I can see everything in a calendar  view
* Of course, should look nice and beautiful

So, I start to work out my own solution -  Hydrogen!  And I hope it can help you too :-) !
